This mod adds a little variety to the animals of your colony. When an animal becomes bonded to a colonist (or simply has a master), said animal will gain a random skill/capacity buff. These buffs remain on the animal unless the animal loses its bond/master.
Check the mod settings to allow any colony animal with a master to receive buffs instead of only bonded animals along with other options.
